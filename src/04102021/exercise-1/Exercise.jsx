This component should render and do the followings:

1. Render an input and a paragraph element
2. What you type in in the input field should be displayed in the paragraph element

🎁 Bonus: Try to display a warning message below the input field that only gets rendered on the screen when word count exceeds 20
💡 Hint: You guessed it, "useState" hook is your good friend.
