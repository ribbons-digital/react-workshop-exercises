Copy over what you finished in exercise-2 and continue here

This component should do the followings:

1. Create a 404 or redirect Route
2. Add a navbar that allows you to navigate to different pages
3. Create a button in the component for your dynamic route. Clicking on the button should programmatically navigate to a page of your choice
and carry over some state to the destination page (component)
4. Show the state that's carried over in the destination page (component). It can be rendering it as text on the page or a simple console.log

** You can create and place your custom components in the "components" folder

üéÅ Bonus: Try to show active state for the item that's clicked on in the navbar
