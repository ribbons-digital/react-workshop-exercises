## Structure of the exercises

- Exercises for each week are organised folders named by date. (e.g: 04102021 -> Exercise for the week of Oct. 4th)
- There will be multiple exercise folders (exercise-1, exercise-2...etc)
- Each exercise folder has a top-level `Exercise` component
- The top-level `Exercise` component is being rendered in the `App` component
- To see your updated result for the exercise you are working on on the screen , simply update the import path in the `App` component that points to that exercise.
